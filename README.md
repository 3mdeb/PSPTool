# psptool

psptool is a Swiss Army knife for dealing with **binary blobs** mainly **delivered with BIOS updates** targeting **AMD platforms**. 

It is based on reverse-engineering efforts of AMD's proprietary **simple filesystem** used to **pack its blobs** into standardized **UEFI Firmware Images**. These are usually 16MB in size and can be conveniently parsed by [UEFITool](https://github.com/LongSoft/UEFITool). However, all binary blobs by AMD are located in an unparsable area of the UEFI image marked as *padding* by UEFITool.

**psptool favourably works with BIOS ROM files** such as UEFI images â€“ as they can be obtained labeled *BIOS updates* from OEMs and IBVs. However, it won't complain about additional headers such as an Aptio Capsule header.

usage: psptool [-h] [-E | -X | -R | -U] file

Parse, display, extract and manipulate PSP firmware inside BIOS ROMs, UEFI volumes and so on.

positional arguments:
  file                  Binary file to be parsed for PSP firmware _directories

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            Show this help message and exit.

  -E, --entries         Default: Parse and display PSP firmware entries.
                        [-d idx] [-n] [-i] [-v]

                        -d idx:     specifies directory_index (default: all _directories)
                        -n:         hide duplicate entries from listings
                        -i:         display additional entry header info
                        -a:         display entry architecture (powered by cpu_rec)
                        -v:         display even more info (AGESA Version, Entropy, MD5)
                        -t csvfile: only display entries found in the given SPI trace
                                    (see psptrace for details)
  -X, --extract-entry   Extract one or more PSP firmware entries.
                        [-d idx [-e idx]] [-n] [-u] [-k] [-v] [-o outfile]

                        -d idx:  specifies directory_index (default: all _directories)
                        -e idx:  specifies entry_index (default: all entries)
                        -n:      skip duplicate entries
                        -u:      uncompress compressed entries
                        -k:      convert _pubkeys into PEM format
                        -v:      increase output verbosity
                        -o file: specifies outfile/outdir (default: stdout/$PWD)
  -R, --replace-directory-entry
                        Copy a new entry into the ROM file and replace an existing directory entry with a new address and size.
                        -d idx -e idx -b addr -w size [-s subfile] [-o outfile]

                        -d idx:  specifies directory_index
                        -e idx:  specifies entry_index
                        -b addr: specifies destination address of the new entry
                        -w size: specifies size of the new directory entry (must be at least the size of the new entry)
                        -s file: specifies subfile (i.e. the new entry) (default: stdin)
                        -o file: specifies outfile (default: stdout)
  -U, --update-signatures
                        Re-sign all signatures in the ROM file with a given private key and export a new ROM file.
                        -p private_key [-o outfile]

                        -p file:   specifies a path to the private_key in PEM format for re-signing
                        -o file:   specifies outfile (default: stdout)
